    \end{center}
    
    This is a summary of interview questions found on the internet, in books, \textit{etc.}, along with more in-depth digressions related to quantitative finance. It is a mixed of applied mathematics and computer science.\\
    I am not fond of brainteasers, they are a poor way to assess for a candidate's ability to be an asset for the team. This work smoothly transitioned to a sort of \textit{vademecum} in applied mathematics: through several questions, it goes through different techniques that are easy to forget with time. I myself refer to it quite often when I forget about how to write the Lagrangian in a constrained optimization problem, or the general solution of a second-order differential equation...
