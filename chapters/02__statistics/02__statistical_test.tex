Let's assume you have a batch of a hundred observations (numbers). There are two hypotheses and one is true :
\begin{itemize}
    \item $H_0$: these observations are independent draws from a Gaussian $\mathcal{N}(0, 1/18)$,
    \item $H_1$:  each observation has been obtained by averaging $6$ uniforms $\mathcal{U}([-1,1])$ random variables.
\end{itemize}
How would you find out which scenario is true.\\
