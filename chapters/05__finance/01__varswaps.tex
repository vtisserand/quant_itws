\section{Betting on volatility -- around varswaps}

\begin{tcolorbox}[width=\linewidth, sharp corners=all, colback=white!95!black]
    A desk is interested in expressing a view on volatility. To do so they suggest entering a variance swap contract with payoff:
    \[\dfrac{1}{T} \displaystyle \int_{0}^{T} \sigma_t^2 dt - \sigma_K^2\]

    On the sell side, how would you price and hedge such a contract?\newline
    On the buy side, if your goal is to tail-hedge your portfolio, could you suggest other approaches than buying a varswap?
