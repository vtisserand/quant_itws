\section{Betting on volatility -- around varswaps}

\begin{tcolorbox}[width=\linewidth, sharp corners=all, colback=white!95!black]
    A desk is interested in expressing a view on volatility. To do so they suggest entering a variance swap contract with payoff:
    \[\dfrac{1}{T} \displaystyle \int_{0}^{T} \sigma_t^2 dt - \sigma_K^2\]

    On the sell side, how would you price and hedge such a contract?\newline
    On the buy side, if your goal is to tail-hedge your portfolio, could you suggest other approaches than buying a varswap?

We assume a geometric brownian motion dynamic for the underlying asset $S_t$. Could we find a smooth transformation of the asset that would help in the replication of the payoff? Applying It√¥'s formula to $f(S_t)$, we get:
\[
f(S_t) = f(S_0) + \displaystyle \int_0^T f'(S_t) \,dS_t + \dfrac{1}{2}\displaystyle \int_0^T f''(S_t) \,d\langle S_t\rangle = f(S_0) + \displaystyle \int_0^T f'(S_t) \,dS_t + \dfrac{1}{2}\displaystyle \int_0^T f''(S_t) \sigma_t^2 S_t^2 \,dt
\]

To make the variance swap variable leg appear, remark that taking $f = \log$ indeed yields $f''(x) = x^{-2}$, thus
