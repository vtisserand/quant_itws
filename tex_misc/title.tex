    \textbf{Abstract}
    \end{center}
    
    This is a summary of interview questions that I found and digressed on in quantitative finance. It is a mixed of applied mathematics and computer science.\\
    I am not found of brainteasers, they are a poor way to assess for a candidate's hability to be an asset for the teams. This work smoothly transitioned to a sort of \textit{vademecum} in applied mathematics : through several questions, it goes through several techniques that are easy to forget with time. I myself refer to it quite often when I forget about the way to solve an arithmetico-geometric sequence or the general solution of a second-order differential equation.
