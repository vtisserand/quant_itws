# Quantitative finance interviews

Mainly a personal vademecum about mathematics, computer-science and a bunch of other useful stuff.
Not really what you can expect in every job interview, just a compilation of interesting methods it is useful to know how to apply (or know where to fetch for a reference if one has forgotten how to do it...).
