# Quantitative finance interviews

Mainly a personal vademecum about mathematics, computer-science and a bunch of other useful stuff.
Not really what you can expect in every job interview, just a compilation of interesting methods it is useful to know how to apply (or know where to fetch for a reference if one has forgotten how to do it...).

# TO-DOs

**Statistics**

- [ ] Central limit theorem: demonstration and counterexamples when we alleviate hypothese (lack of independence, lack of identitically distributed)

**Learning algorithms**

- [ ] Feature engineering / data transformations: kernel trick, signatures

**Numerical methods**

- [ ] About Monte-Carlo (variance reduction, QMC)

**Stochastic calculus**

- [ ] Things about the Brownian motion, around the uncountability of its zero set, etc.

**Finance**

- [ ] Varswaps, their replication and some thoughts about tail-hedging
- [ ] Correlation-based products and dispersion trading: [dual-digitals and worst-of](https://quantnet.com/threads/dual-digital-and-worst-of-basket-options.20660/), [discussion](https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/75024/how-to-hedge-a-dual-digital-option)

**Computer science**

- [ ] A dive in triangular arbitrage: union-find, Bellman-Ford, [see this blog post](https://reasonabledeviations.com/2019/03/02/currency-arbitrage-graphs/) or [this paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Y_7tPvfvkNXcA_jkD2RMcNc0VQyRPvF/view)
