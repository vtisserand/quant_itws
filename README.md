# Quantitative finance interviews

Mainly a personal vademecum about mathematics, computer-science and a bunch of other useful stuff.
Not really what you can expect in every job interview, just a compilation of interesting methods it is useful to know how to apply (or know where to fetch for a reference if one has forgotten how to do it...).

# TO-DOs

**Learning algorithms**

- [ ] Feature engineering / data transformations: kernel trick, signatures
      **Numerical methods**
- [ ] About Monte-Carlo (variance reduction, QMC)
      **Finance**
- [ ] Varswaps, their replication and some thoughts about tail-hedging
